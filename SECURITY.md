## Trust Model

Claude-lint is a standalone Rust CLI tool that statically analyzes Claude Code configuration files (CLAUDE.md, settings, MCP configs, etc.) against a set of lint rules. It reads files from the filesystem but does not modify them, execute arbitrary commands, or make network requests during linting.
