## [0.2.2] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- Rust implementation of all 25 structural validators from larch's `validate-plugin-structure.sh`
- Two lint modes: basic (`.claude/` contents) and plugin (full 25-validator suite when `.claude-plugin/` exists)
- CI jobs for Rust build/test/clippy and musl cross-compilation
- `cargo-test` and `cargo-clippy` Makefile targets

### Changed

- `action.yml`: replaced free-form `args` input with typed `path` input
- `/relevant-checks` now runs `cargo test` and `cargo clippy` when Rust files are modified

### Fixed

- V22 docs reference extraction: stop at any `##` heading (bash original had `[^C]` bug)

## [0.2.1] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- Rust linters (cargo fmt, cargo clippy) to CI via pre-commit hooks in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`
- Rust toolchain setup and Cargo cache in CI workflow (`.github/workflows/ci.yaml`)
- Release-on-merge CD pipeline: auto-tag job in `release.yml` triggered on push to main
- Version sync between `package.json` and `Cargo.toml` in `/bump-version` skill
- `make clippy` and `make fmt` Makefile targets for local Rust linting

### Changed

- `apply-bump.sh` now updates both `package.json` and `Cargo.toml` atomically with rollback support
- `release.yml` supports push-to-main trigger (auto-tag + build + release) alongside existing tag-push trigger
- Aligned `Cargo.toml` version to match `package.json` (0.2.0)

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- GitHub Action boilerplate for composite shell-based distribution (`action.yml`, `scripts/install.sh`)
- Multi-platform Rust binary release workflow (`.github/workflows/release.yml`)
- Minimal Rust project scaffolding (`Cargo.toml`, `rust-toolchain.toml`, `src/main.rs`)

## [0.1.4] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- CHANGELOG.md with retroactive entries documenting all prior PRs (#1-#4)

## [0.1.3] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- GitHub Actions CI workflow running third-party linters via pre-commit on PRs to main and manual dispatch
- Makefile with `lint` target for local and CI linter execution

## [0.1.2] - 2026-04-12

### Changed

- Removed redundant explicit allow rules from `.claude/settings.json` since `defaultMode: "bypassPermissions"` already grants all permissions

## [0.1.1] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- Pre-commit linting infrastructure with shellcheck, markdownlint, jsonlint, actionlint, and standard hooks
- `/bump-version` skill for semantic version management via `package.json`
- `/relevant-checks` skill wrapping pre-commit for scoped file validation

### Changed

- Narrowed README.md scope to match actual implementation

## [0.1.0] - 2026-04-12

### Added

- Initial project setup with README
- `.claude/settings.json` with full permissions configuration
