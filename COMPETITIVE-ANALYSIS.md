## Sub-Niche Clusters

The 30 repos cluster into these sub-niches:

- **Comprehensive multi-file linters**: agnix, agentlinter, cclint variants, instrlint
- **SKILL.md focused**: skill-check, pulser, nori-lint, skills-lint, skill-lint, skill-tools, skills-check
- **AGENTS.md focused**: agents-lint, agent-rules-skill, samilozturk/agentlinter
- **Cursor focused**: cursor-doctor
- **Multi-platform**: ai-context-kit, skilllint, crag
- **Security/compliance**: nod
- **LLM-powered**: lint-claude

## Key Insights

1. **agnix (176 stars) is the most comprehensive competitor** — Rust-based CLI + LSP with 399 rules covering 9+ AI platforms. IDE plugins for VS Code, JetBrains, Neovim, Zed. Auto-fix capabilities.

2. **The space is nascent** — most repos created Q1-Q2 2026, 176 stars is the ceiling for dedicated tools. The market is pre-consolidation with no dominant player.

3. **Most tools use deterministic static analysis** — a few exceptions exist (vtemian/lint-claude uses Claude AI for enforcement), but the overwhelming design choice is zero LLM dependency for CI/CD compatibility.

4. **Cross-platform coverage is rare** — only 2-3 tools (agnix, ai-context-kit, skilllint) attempt to lint configs for multiple AI coding platforms simultaneously. Most are Claude-only or Cursor-only.

5. **GitHub Actions integration exists in a few tools** (agent-lint, Pulser, Skills Check CI) but the majority of competitors do not ship published Actions.

6. **SKILL.md linting is an active sub-niche** with 5+ dedicated tools — agent-lint itself has 57 dedicated SKILL.md rules (S001-S057).

7. **Semantic/grounding validation is partially addressed** — agent-lint (dead scripts, path validation), agents-lint, and ctxlint cross-reference context files against the live codebase, but most tools remain purely structural.

8. **None of the 30 identified tools target Gemini agent config specifically** — noting Gemini lacks a standardized config directory format analogous to `.claude/`.

9. **Naming collision is severe** — 4+ repos called "cclint", 3+ called "agentlinter", 3+ called "agent-lint", creating discoverability challenges.

## Risk Assessment

**Medium**. Primary risks:

- **Platform spec instability** — if Anthropic/Cursor/OpenAI change config formats, all linters break
- **First-party tooling** — platform vendors may release built-in validation that obsoletes third-party linters
- **Fragmentation** — 20+ competing tools all sub-200 stars, poor discoverability

Mitigating factors: no dominant player has emerged, agent-lint's 104 rules + GitHub Actions + Rust performance provide a solid foundation.

## Open Questions

1. **What specific rules do competitors implement that agent-lint doesn't?** Agnix claims 399 rules vs agent-lint's 104 — a deep rule comparison would identify borrowable ideas.
2. **Which tools have GitHub Actions marketplace entries?** Pulser, Skills Check CI, and agent-lint do; most others don't. Distribution advantage.
3. **How stable are these repos?** Most are <4 months old with single contributors. Monitoring survival rates would inform competitive strategy.
4. **Would Anthropic/OpenAI/Cursor ship first-party linting?** Existential risk for all third-party tools.

## Architectural Patterns Observed

The tools divide into three architectural camps:

1. **Monorepo multi-surface** (agnix only) — single Rust core distributed via CLI, LSP, MCP, and WASM. Most sophisticated but most complex to maintain.
2. **Monolithic CLI** (agentlinter, agents-lint, lintlang, cursor-doctor, cclint variants) — single executable with embedded rules. Optimizes for simplicity and zero-config.
3. **Extensible framework** (claudelint/stbenjam, ctxlint) — plugin mechanisms allowing external rule authoring.

Key architectural divide: **structural/syntactic linters** (checking file format, schema, frontmatter) vs **semantic/grounding linters** (checking whether context claims match the actual codebase). agent-lint bridges both with its dead-script detection, path validation, and cross-field consistency checks.
